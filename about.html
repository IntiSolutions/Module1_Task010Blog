        <h3>Our story</h3>
        <p>We can describe ourself as IT entrepreneurs. The words which describe our organization are: group harmony, servant leadership, perseverance, proactivity, commitment, ownership and goal orientation. 
        During our work & life experience we discovered our interest in travelling, all type of languages, IT related projects, Risk Management and Team Work Achievement. 
        </p>
        <p>
        We managed a portfolio of IT audits and IT advisory projects for different major accounting firms. In these projects we applied our knowledge of audit procedures and completed high-quality IT audits.
        Most of our former clients operate in the financial service industry. It is in this industry where we enjoy shedding light on IT risks which manifest, among others, during the development of innovative 
        customer focused applications. Underlining these risks, addressing them and working out solutions gives us energy.
